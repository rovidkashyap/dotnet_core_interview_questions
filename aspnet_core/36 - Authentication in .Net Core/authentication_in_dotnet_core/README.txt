Handling different types of authentication in .NET Core involves configuring authentication schemes 
and middleware according to the specific requirements of your application. 

Below are some common types of authentication and how to implement them in a .NET Core application:

1. Cookie Authentication

	- Cookie authentication is often used for traditional web applications where the user logs in once 
	  and remains authenticated until the cookie expires.

	- Setup Cookie Authentication

		- Add the necessary services in `Program.cs`
		- Create a login action in your controller to handle the user login.

2. JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication

	- JWT authentication is typically used for API applications where tokens are issued and validated 
	  for each request.

	- Setup JWT Authentication
		
		- Install the necessary NuGet package.
			`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.
		- Configure JWT authentication in `Program.cs`.
		- Use the authentication middleware in the request pipeline.
		- Create a method to generate JWT tokens.

3. OAuth2 and OpenID Connect

	- OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are commonly used for authenticating users via third-party providers 
	  like Google, Facebook, or custom identity providers.

	- Setup OAuth2/OpenID Connect

		- Install the necessary NuGet package.
			`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect`.
		- Configure OAuth2/OpenID Connect in `Program.cs`.
		- Use the authentication middleware in the request pipeline.
		- create actions for login and logout.

4. API Key Authentication

	- API Key authentication involves clients passing a unique key in the request headers.

	- Middleware for API Key Authentication
		- Create a custom middleware to validate API keys



By implementing these different types of authentication, you can secure your .NET Core applications 
according to various requirements and use cases. 

Each type of authentication offers different benefits and is suitable for different scenarios, whether 
it's traditional web applications, APIs, or integrations with third-party identity providers.
