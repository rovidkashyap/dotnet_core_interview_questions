Handling large file uploads in .NET Core involves several steps to ensure the process is efficient, 
secure, and user-friendly. Here are the key steps and best practices to handle large file uploads in 
.NET Core applications:

1. Configure Maximum Request Limits

	- By default, .NET Core limits the size of file uploads. You can configure these limits in your 
	  `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` file:

	- Check your `Program.cs` file.

2. Increase Request TImeout

	- For large file uploads, you may need to increase the request timeout to prevent the server from 
	  timing out during long uploads. This can be done in your `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` file:

	- Check your `Program.cs` file.

3. Streaming File Uploads

	- Streaming file uploads can help you handle large files without consuming too much memory. 

	- Check the Controller for the code.

4. Chunked Uploads

	- For very large files, consider implementing chunked uploads. This approach breaks the file into 
	  smaller chunks and uploads them sequentially.

	- Check the	`chunksUpload.js` file for code.

5. Validation and Security

	- File Size Validation: Validate the size of the uploaded file to ensure it doesn’t exceed your 
	  maximum allowed limit.

	- File Type Validation: Validate the type of the uploaded file to prevent malicious files.

	- Security Considerations: Ensure the file paths are sanitized and never allow direct paths from 
	  user input.

6. User Feedback

	- Provide feedback to users during the upload process, especially for large files. This can be 
	  done using progress bars or upload status messages.

7. Scalability and Performance

	- Storage Solutions: Consider using scalable storage solutions like Azure Blob Storage, Amazon S3, 
	  or similar services for storing large files.

	- Background Processing: Use background processing for post-upload tasks (e.g., virus scanning, 
	  thumbnail generation) using services like Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, or Hangfire.


By following these best practices, you can handle large file uploads in a .NET Core application 
efficiently and securely.
