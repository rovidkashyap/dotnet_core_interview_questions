Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts 
into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal data, hijack user sessions, or perform 
other malicious actions. ASP.NET Core provides various strategies and tools to protect applications 
from XSS attacks.

1. INPUT VALIDATION -

Validate all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats. This can help prevent the injection 
of malicious scripts.

2. OUTPUT ENCODING -

Always encode user input before displaying it on the web page. This ensures that any injected script is 
treated as data rather than executable code.

In Razor views, the @ directive automatically HTML-encodes output by default.

3. USE ANTIXSS LIBRARY -

Microsoft provides an AntiXSS library, part of the System.Web.Helpers namespace, which can be used to 
help prevent XSS attacks by encoding output.

4. CONTENT SECURITY POLICY (CSP) -

Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) helps mitigate XSS attacks by restricting the sources from 
which content can be loaded.

5. HTTPONLY AND SECURE COOKIES -

Set the HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies to prevent access to the cookies from client-side scripts 
and ensure they are only sent over HTTPS.

6. USE CSP NONCES -

Using nonces in CSP allows you to specify which inline scripts are allowed to execute, providing another 
layer of security.

7. AVOID INLINE JAVASCRIPTS -

Avoid using inline JavaScript whenever possible. Instead, keep scripts in external files and include 
them using <script src="..."></script>.

8. USE FRAMEWORKS AND LIBRARIES SAFELY -

Ensure that any JavaScript frameworks or libraries you use are up to date and from trusted sources. 
This reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through third-party code.

9. REGULAR SECURITY AUDITS -

Regularly perform security audits and code reviews to identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities. 
Automated tools and manual reviews can help catch issues that may have been overlooked.

10. USE MODERN DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES -

Follow modern web development practices, such as using let and const instead of var, and avoiding the
use of eval or similar functions that execute string content as code.
