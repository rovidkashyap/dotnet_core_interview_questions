Optimize Performance of a .Net Core application involves various strategies that span across code
optimization, efficient use of resources, and proper configuration.

1. Use Asynchronous Programming 

2. Optimize Data Access

	- Use Entity Framework Core wisely: Avoid fetching unnecessary data (use `Selct()` or `Include()`).
	- Use Caching: Implement caching to reduce database load for frequently accessed data.

3. Efficient Memory Management

	- Use Span<T> and Memory<T> for high performance memory operations.

4. Use Dependency Injection (DI) Correctly

	- Scope services properly: Singleton, Scoped and Transient services should be used appropriately

5. Minimize Startup Time

	- Precompile Views: Precompile Razor Views to reduce the startup time for web applications.
	- Use Application Insight: Monitor application performance and detect slow startup issues.

6. Optimize Application Configuration

	- Set Proper environment variables: Use `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` to differentaite between Development,
	  Staging, and Production environments.

	- Configure Kestrel: Optimize Kestrel server settings for your production environment.

7. Use CDN and Caching for Static Files

	- Cache-Control headers: Set appropriate caching headers for static files.
	- Content Delivery Network (CDN): Use a CDN to deliver static files more effeciently.

8. Optimize Logging

	- Reduce logging verbosity in production to minimize the performance impact.

9. Perform Load Testing

10. Use Profiler and Diagnostics Tools

	- Visual Studio profiler: Use it to profile your application and identify performance issues.
	- dotnet-trace: Collect performance traces from you application.
