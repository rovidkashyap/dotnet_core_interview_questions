AutoMapper is an object-to-object mapping library that helps you to transform one object type into 
another, typically used for mapping between domain models and view models in ASP.Net Core applications. 
The primary goal of AutoMapper is to simplify the process of transferring data between objects, 
avoiding repetitive and error-prone manual mapping code.

1. Install AutoMapper - `AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`

2. Define your Model

3. Creating a Mapping Profile - Define the mapping configuration in a profile class.

4. Register AutoMapper in the DI Container

5. Inject and Use AutoMapper

AutoMapper in ASP.Net Core helps to streamline the process of mapping objects, which can significantly 
reduce boilerplate code, enhance consistency, and improve maintainability in your applications. 

It is particularly useful when dealing with complex data transformations and projections.
