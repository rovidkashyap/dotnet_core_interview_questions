Implementing caching in ASP.NET Core is essential for improving the performance and scalability of your 
applications. Caching helps to store frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need to fetch data 
from slower sources like databases. 

ASP.NET Core provides several caching options to suit different scenarios. Here’s how you can implement 
caching and the various caching options available:

Caching Options in ASP.Net Core

1. In-Memory Caching: Stores cache data in the memory of the web server.

2. Distributed Caching: Allows caching across multiple servers, making it suitable for distributed
						environments.

		- SQL Server Cache: Stores cache data in a SQL Server database.

		- Redis Cache: Uses a Redis server to store cache data.

		- NCache: A distributed cache solution for .Net applications.

3. Response Caching: Caches HTTP responses to reduce the need to generate the same respone multiple times.
