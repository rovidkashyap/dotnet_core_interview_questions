Deploying a .NET Core application to a production environment involves several steps, including 
preparing the application, configuring the server, deploying the application, and configuring the 
web server. Here’s a comprehensive guide:

1. Prepare Your Appliction

	- Ensure your Application is Production-Ready: This includes removing any debugging code, setting
	  up proper configuration for production, and ensuring all necessary dependencies are included.

	- Set the Production COnfiguration: Configuration in `appsettings.Production.json`, set the 
	  appropriate configuration settings for the production enviroment.

2. Publish Your Application

	- Use the `dotnet publish` command to create a production-ready package of your application.

	`dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish`

3. Set Up the Server

	Option 1: Deploying on a Windows Server with IIS

		1. Install .NET Core Hosting Bundle.

		2. Configure 

			2.1 Open IIS Manager and create new website.
			2.2 Set the Physical path to the directory where you published your application.
			2.3 Set the port and host name.
			2.4 Ensure that the Application Pool is using the `No Managed Code` option.

		3. Deploy Your Application

			3.1 Copy the published files from your development machine to the server.
			3.2 Ensure that web.config file is present and properly configured.

	Option 2: Deploying on a Linux Server with Nginx

		1. Install .Net Core Runtime.

		2. Install and Configure Nginx

			2.1 Install Nginx - `sudo apt-get install nginx`
			2.2 Configure Nginx to proxy requests to your .NET Core application
				`sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default`
			2.3 Restart Nginx to apply the configuration.

		3. Deploy your Application

			3.1 Copy the published files to the server.
			3.2 Create a systemd service to manage your application
			3.3 Start and enable the service

		4. Monitor and Maintain Your Application

			4.1 Logging: Ensure that logging is properly configured and that logs are being monitored.
			4.2 Application Insights: Consider using Application Insights or another monitoring tool to
				track application performance and errors.
			4.3 Automated Deployments: Use CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments to ensure consistency
				and reduce deployment errors.


By following these steps, you can successfully deploy your .NET Core application to a production 
environment, ensuring it is performant, reliable, and maintainable.
