    Core CLR(Core Common Language Runtime) is the runtime used by .NET Core applications. It is a 
    cross-platform, high-performance, lightweight, and modular runtime for executing .NET 
    applications. Core CLR is a key component of the .NET Core ecosystem, providing the essential 
    services needed to run .NET applications, including memory management, garbage collection, 
    assembly loading, security, exception handling, and interoperability with native code.

    KEY FEATURES OF CORE CLR

    1. Cross-Platform: Core CLR is designed to run on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, 
                       and Linux, enabling .NET Core applications to be developed and deployed across 
                       different operating systems.

    2. High Performance: Core CLR is optimized for high performance, making it suitable for a wide 
                         range of application types, from cloud services to console applications. It 
                         includes a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that compiles Intermediate Language 
                         (IL) code to native machine code at runtime.

    3. Lightweight and Modular: Core CLR is lightweight and modular, allowing developers to include 
                                only the necessary components for their applications. This modularity 
                                reduces the overall footprint of applications and improves deployment 
                                flexibility.

    4. Open Source: Core CLR is open source, hosted on GitHub, and developed by the .NET community and 
                    Microsoft. This openness encourages community contributions and transparency in 
                    development.

    5. Managed Execution: Core CLR provides managed execution of .NET code, ensuring safety, security, 
                          and portability across different environments. It includes features like 
                          type safety, automatic memory management, and exception handling.

    6. Garbage Collection: Core CLR includes a sophisticated garbage collector (GC) that automatically 
                           manages memory allocation and reclamation, helping to prevent memory leaks 
                           and optimize application performance.

    7. Interoperability: Core CLR supports interoperability with native code through Platform 
                         Invocation Services (P/Invoke) and the use of COM components. This allows 
                         .NET applications to interact with existing native libraries and components.
