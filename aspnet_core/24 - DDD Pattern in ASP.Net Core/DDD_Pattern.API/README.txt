Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that emphasizes the importance of a 
rich domain model and collaboration between technical and domain experts. 

Implementing DDD in .NET Core 8 involves structuring your project in a way that aligns with the core 
principles of DDD: 

focusing on the domain and its logic, using bounded contexts, and maintaining a ubiquitous language.

Project Structure :

A typically DDD-based project in .Net Core might be structures as follows:

src/
|-- DDD_Pattern.Domain/
|	|-- Entities/
|	|-- ValueObjects/
|	|-- Aggregates/
|	|-- Repositories/
|	|-- Services/
|	|-- Exceptions/
|-- DDD_Pattern.Application/
|	|-- Commands/
|	|-- Queries/
|	|-- Services/
|	|-- DTOs/
|-- DDD_Pattern.Infrastructure/
|	|-- Persistence/
|	|-- Repositories/
|	|-- Configurations/
|	|-- Migrations/
|-- DDD_Pattern.API/
	|-- Controllers/
	|-- Models/
	|-- Middleware/
	|-- Startup.cs

STEP-By-STEP IMPLEMENTATION

STEP 1 - Define the Domain Model - Entities/Order.cs

STEP 2 - Define the Repository Interface - Repositories/IOrderRepository.cs

STEP 3 - Implement the Repository - Infrastructure/Repositories/OrderRepository.cs

STEP 4 - Define Application Services - Application/Services/OrderService.cs

STEP 5 - Use Application Services in Controllers - API/Controllers/OrdersController.cs


Summary

- Entities - represent domain objects with a unique identity.

- Value Objects - are immutable and describe certain aspects of the domain.

- Repositories - handle data access and persistence for aggregates.

- Application Services coordinate use cases and interact with repositories.

- API Controllers use application services to handle the HTTP requests.
