Implementing caching in a .NET Core application can significantly improve performance and reduce the 
load on your server by storing frequently accessed data in memory or on the client-side. 

Here’s how to implement HTTP caching, client-side caching, and server-side caching in a .NET Core 
application:

1. HTTP Caching

	HTTP caching involves setting cache headers in the HTTP response to instruct clients and intermediate 
	proxies on how to cache responses.

	- Configure Response Caching Middleware

		First, add the Response Caching middleware to your `Program.cs` file.

	- Set Cache Headers in Controllers
		
		Set the appropriate caching headers in your controllers to enable HTTP caching:

2. Client-Side Caching

	Client-side caching can be controlled using cache headers sent from the server. These headers 
	instruct the client’s browser on how to cache the response.

	- Cache-Control Headers

		Set the Cache-Control header to define how clients should cache the response:

	- ETag and Last-Modified Headers

		Use ETag and Last-Modified headers to implement conditional requests:

3. Server-Side Caching

	Server-side caching involves storing data in a cache on the server to reduce database load and 
	improve response times.

	- In-Memory Caching

		Add the memory cache services to your `Program.cs` file

4. Distribute Caching

	- For larger applications, consider using a distributed cache like Redis or SQL Server.

		Add the distributed cache services to your `Program.cs`
